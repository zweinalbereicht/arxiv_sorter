Title: Diagrammatics for the Inverse Problem in Spin Systems and Simple
Liquids
Authors: Tobias K\"uhn and Fr\'ed\'eric van Wijland
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.dis-nn cond-mat.soft
Comments: 32 pages, 3 figures
\\
  Given data for which averages and correlations are known, we ask what the
values are of the parameters of a given model and the resulting entropy
consistent with these data. Of course, in general, no exact calculation
directly from the model is available. A particular situation is that of a
model
characterized by continuous degrees of freedom and a polynomial probability
weight. Indeed perturbation expansions around a Gaussian have been
implemented
in the last 60 years. However, there are models for which the exactly
solvable
part is non-Gaussian, such as independent Ising spins in a field, or an
ideal
gas of particles. We implement a diagrammatic perturbative scheme in weak
correlations around a non-Gaussian yet solvable probability weight. This
applies in particular to spin models (Ising, Potts, Heisenberg) with weak
couplings, or to a simple liquid with a weak interaction potential. Our
method
casts systems with discrete degrees of freedom and those with continuous
ones
within the same theoretical framework that reduces to the well-known Feynman
diagrammatics when the core theory is Gaussian.

Title: Residual Entropy of Glasses and the Expression of the Third-Law
  Expression
Authors: Koun Shirai
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech physics.class-ph
\\
  The third law of thermodynamics dictates that the entropy of materials
becomes zero as temperature ($T$) approaches zero. Contrarily, glass and
other
similar materials exhibit nonzero entropy at $T=0$, which contradicts the
third
law. For over a century, it has been a common practice to evade this
problem by
regarding glass as nonequilibrium. However, this treatment causes many
inconsistencies in thermodynamics theory. This paper provides resolutions to
these inconsistencies and provides a rigorous expression of the third law
without any exception. To seek the entropy origin, the anthropomorphic
feature
of entropy must be resolved. Because entropy can be uniquely determined only
when thermodynamic coordinates (TCs) are specified, we have to know which
are
TCs. This requires the reconsideration of the definition of equilibrium for
solids in an unambiguous way, which does not depend on the solid structure.
On
this basis, it is deduced that TCs of solids are the equilibrium positions
of
atoms. TCs comprise a thermodynamic space, on which a unique value can be
assigned to the entropy. For solids, equilibrium states are specified by
discrete points in the thermodynamic space, which define atom
configurations.
Among various atom configurations, only one is thermally activated at
sufficiently low temperatures, and others are called frozen configuration,
which do not contribute to the temperature dependence of entropy in that
region. The rigorous statement of the third law has been established by
expressing that the entropy associated with the active configuration
vanishes
at $T=0$. Residual entropy arises when the entropy is evaluated on an
extended
space including the frozen configurations, which were previously active at
high
temperatures. The reconciliation of the two different views is explained
through several debates on the glass transition.

Title: Microreversibility, fluctuation relations, and response properties
in 1D
  Kitaev Chain
Authors: Fan Zhang, Jiayin Gu, and H. T. Quan
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech
Comments: 14 pages, 7 figures. Comments and suggestions are welcomed
\\
  We analytically calculate the cumulant generating function of energy and
particle transport in an open 1D Kitaev chain by utilizing the Keldysh
technique. The joint distribution of particle and energy currents obeys
different fluctuation relations in different regions of the parameter space
as
a result of $U$(1) symmetry breaking and energy conservation. We discuss the
thermoelectricity of the Kitaev chain as a three terminal system and derive
an
analytical expression of the maximum work power. The response theory up to
the
second order is explicitly checked, and the result is consistent with the
relations derived from the fluctuation relation.

Title: Contact process with simultaneous spatial and temporal disorder
Authors: Xuecheng Ye and Thomas Vojta
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech
Comments: 13 pages, 14 figures included
\\
  We study the absorbing-state phase transition in the one-dimensional
contact
process under the combined influence of spatial and temporal random
disorders.
We focus on situations in which the spatial and temporal disorders decouple.
Couched in the language of epidemic spreading, this means that some spatial
regions are, at all times, more favorable than others for infections, and
some
time periods are more favorable than others independent of spatial
location. We
employ a generalized Harris criterion to discuss the stability of the
directed
percolation universality class against such disorder. We then perform
large-scale Monte Carlo simulations to analyze the critical behavior in
detail.
We also discuss how the Griffiths singularities that accompany the
nonequilibrium phase transition are affected by the simultaneous presence of
both disorders.

Title: Insight into ground-state spin arrangement and bipartite
entanglement of
  the polymeric coordination compound [Dy$_2$Cu$_2$]$_n$ through the
symmetric
  spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg orthogonal-dimer chain
Authors: Lucia G\'alisov\'a
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech
Comments: 9 pages, 5 figures, to be published in JMMM
\\
  The ground-state spin arrangement and the bipartite entanglement within
Cu$^{2+}$-Cu$^{2+}$ dimers across the magnetization process of the 4f-3d
heterometallic coordination polymer
[{Dy(hfac)$_2$(CH$_3$OH)}$_2${Cu(dmg)(Hdmg)}$_2$]$_n$ (H$_2$dmg =
dimethylglyoxime, Hhfac = 1,1,1,5,5,5-hexafluoropentane-2,4-dione) are
theoretically examined using the symmetric isotropic spin-$1/2$
Ising-Heisenberg orthogonal-dimer chain. The numerical results point to five
possible ground states of the compound with three different degrees of the
quantum entanglement within Cu$^{2+}$-Cu$^{2+}$. Besides the standard
ferrimagnetic and saturated phases without quantum entanglement of Cu$^{2+}$
ions, which are manifested in low-temperature magnetization curve as wide
plateaus at the non-saturated magnetization $16.26\mu_{\rm B}$ and at the
saturation value $20.82\mu_{\rm B}$, respectively, one also finds an
intriguing
singlet-like phase with just partial entanglement within Cu$^{2+}$-Cu$^{2+}$
and two singlet phases with fully entangled Cu$^{2+}$-Cu$^{2+}$ dimers. The
former quantum phase can be identified in the low-temperature magnetization
process as very narrow intermediate plateau at the magnetization
$9.27\mu_{\rm
B}$ per unit cell, while the latter ones as zero magnetization plateau and
intermediate plateau at the magnetization $18.54\mu_{\rm B}$. Non-monotonous
temperature variations of the concurrence, through which the entanglement
within cooper dimers is quantified, point to the possible temporary thermal
activation of the entangled states of Cu$^{2+}$-Cu$^{2+}$ also above
non-entangled ferrimagnetic and saturated phases.

Title: Percolation in a simple cubic lattice with distortion
Authors: Sayantan Mitra, Dipa Saha and Ankur Sensharma
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech
Comments: 11 pages, 8 figures
\\
  Site percolation in a distorted simple cubic lattice is characterized
numerically employing the Newman-Ziff algorithm. Distortion is administered
in
the lattice by systematically and randomly dislocating its sites from their
regular positions. The amount of distortion is tunable by a parameter called
the distortion parameter. In this model, two occupied neighboring sites are
considered connected only if the distance between them is less than a
predefined value called the connection threshold. It is observed that the
percolation threshold always increases with distortion if the connection
threshold is equal to or greater than the lattice constant of the regular
lattice. On the other hand, if the connection threshold is less than the
lattice constant, the percolation threshold first decreases, then increases
steadily as distortion is increased. It is shown that the variation of the
percolation threshold can be well explained by the change in the fraction of
occupied bonds with distortion. The values of the relevant critical
exponents
of the transition strongly indicate that percolation in regular and
distorted
simple cubic lattices belong to the same universality class. It is also
demonstrated that this model is intrinsically distinct from the site-bond
percolation model.

Title: Fluctuations of entropy production of a run-and-tumble particle
Authors: Prajwal Padmanabha, Daniel Maria Busiello, Amos Maritan, Deepak
Gupta
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech
Comments: 13 pages, 6 figures
\\
  Out-of-equilibrium systems continuously generate entropy, with its rate of
production being a fingerprint of non-equilibrium conditions. In small-scale
dissipative systems subject to thermal noise, fluctuations of entropy
production are significant. Hitherto, mean and variance have been abundantly
studied, even if higher moments might be important to fully characterize the
system of interest. Here, we introduce a graphical method to compute any
moment
of entropy production for a generic discrete-state system. Then, we focus
on a
paradigmatic model of active particles, i.e., run-and-tumble dynamics, which
resembles the motion observed in several microorganisms. Employing our
framework, we compute the first three cumulants of the entropy production
for a
discrete version of this model. We also compare our analytical results with
numerical simulations. We find that as the number of states increases, the
distribution of entropy production deviates from a Gaussian. Finally, we
extend
our framework to a continuous state-space run-and-tumble model, using an
appropriate scaling of the transition rates. The approach here presented
might
help uncover the features of non-equilibrium fluctuations of any current in
biological systems operating out-of-equilibrium.

Title: Electric double layers with modulated surface charge density: Exact
2D
  results
Authors: Ladislav \v{S}amaj
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech
Comments: 30 pages, 5 figures
Journal-ref: J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 55 (2022) 275001
DOI: 10.1088/1751-8121/ac72d8
\\
  Electric double layers (EDL) with counterions only, say electrons with the
elementary charge $-e$, in thermal equilibrium at the inverse temperature
$\beta$ are considered. In particular, we study the effect of the surface
charge modulation on the particle number density profile and the pressure.
The
mobile particles are constrained to the surface of a 2D cylinder and
immersed
in vacuum (no dielectric image charges). An EDL corresponds to the
end-circle
of the cylinder which carries a (fixed) position-dependent line charge
density.
The geometries of one single EDL and two EDLs at distance $d$ are
considered;
the particle density profile is studied for both geometries, the effective
interaction of two EDLs is given by the particle pressure on either of the
line
walls. For any coupling constant $\Gamma\equiv \beta e^2 = 2\times {\rm
integer}$, there exists a mapping of the 2D one-component Coulomb system
onto
the 1D interacting anticommuting-field theory defined on a chain of sites.
Using specific transformation symmetries of anticommuting variables, the
contact value theorem is generalized to the EDL with modulated line charge
density. For the free-fermion coupling $\Gamma=2$ it is shown that, under
certain conditions, the matrix of interaction strengths between
anticommuting
variables diagonalizes itself which permits one to obtain exact formulas for
the particle density profile as well as the pressure. The obtained results
confirm the previous indications of weak-coupling and Monte Carlo
observations
that the surface charge inhomogeneity implies an enhancement of the
counterion
density at the contact with the charged line and a diminution of the
pressure
between two parallel lines in comparison with the uniformly charged ones
(with
the same mean charge densities).

Title: How criticality meets bifurcation in compressive failure of
disordered
  solids
Authors: Ashwij Mayya, Estelle Berthier, Laurent Ponson
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft physics.data-an physics.geo-ph
Comments: 29 pages, 10 figures including the supplementary information
\\
  Continuum mechanics describes compressive failure as a standard
bifurcation
in the response of a material to an increasing load: damage, which initially
grows uniformly in the material, localizes within a thin band at failure.
Yet,
experiments recording the acoustic activity preceding localization evidence
power-law distributed failure precursors of increasing size, suggesting that
compressive failure is a critical phenomenon. We examine here this apparent
contradiction by probing the spatial organization of the damage activity and
its evolution until localization during compression experiments of 2D
cellular
solids. The intermittent damage evolution measured in our experiments is
adequately described by a non-stationary depinning equation derived from
damage
mechanics and reminiscent of critical phenomena. In this description,
precursors are damage cascades emerging from the interplay between the
material's disorder and the long-range stress redistributions following
individual damage events. Yet, the divergence of their characteristic size
close to failure, which we observe in our experiments, is not the signature
of
a transition towards criticality. Instead, the system remains at a fixed
distance to the critical point at all stages of the damage evolution. The
divergence results from the progressive loss of stability of the material
as it
is driven towards localization. Thus, our study shows that compressive
failure
is a standard bifurcation for which the material disorder plays a marginal
role. It also shows that precursory activity constitute by-products of the
evolution towards localization and can serve to build a predictive method to
assess the residual lifetime of structures.

Title: Time to reach the maximum for a stationary stochastic process

Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.soft
Comments: 57 pages, 19 figures. This is a longer version of
arXiv:2104.07346,
  published in Europhysics Letters
\\
  We consider a one-dimensional stationary time series of fixed duration
$T$.
We investigate the time $t_{\rm m}$ at which the process reaches the global
maximum within the time interval $[0,T]$. By using a path-decomposition
technique, we compute the probability density function $P(t_{\rm m}|T)$ of
$t_{\rm m}$ for several processes, that are either at equilibrium (such as
the
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process) or out of equilibrium (such as Brownian motion
with
stochastic resetting). We show that for equilibrium processes the
distribution
of $P(t_{\rm m}|T)$ is always symmetric around the midpoint $t_{\rm
m}=T/2$, as
a consequence of the time-reversal symmetry. This property can be used to
detect nonequilibrium fluctuations in stationary time series. Moreover, for
a
diffusive particle in a confining potential, we show that the scaled
distribution $P(t_{\rm m}|T)$ becomes universal, i.e., independent of the
details of the potential, at late times. This distribution $P(t_{\rm m}|T)$
becomes uniform in the "bulk" $1\ll t_{\rm m}\ll T$ and has a nontrivial
universal shape in the "edge regimes" $t_{\rm m}\to0$ and $t_{\rm m} \to T$.
Some of these results have been announced in a recent Letter [Europhys.

Title: Many-body quantum chaos and emergence of Ginibre ensemble
Authors: Saumya Shivam, Andrea De Luca, David A. Huse, Amos Chan
Categories: cond-mat.stat-mech cond-mat.str-el hep-th quant-ph
Comments: 7+16 pages, 2+12 figures
\\
  We establish a connection between many-body quantum chaotic (MBQC) systems
and the Ginibre random matrix ensemble (GinUE) - namely that non-Hermitian
GinUE behaviors emerge in spatially-extended MBQC systems in the space
direction, just as Hermitian random matrix behaviours emerge in MBQC
systems in
the time direction. We demonstrate the emergence of GinUE firstly in
translational invariant (TI) MBQC systems, which can be associated with dual
transfer matrices with complex-valued spectra, before generalizing to
spatially-random systems. We argue and demonstrate that the dual spectra of
TI
MBQC systems necessarily have non-trivial and universal correlations due to
the
existence of a linear ramp in the spectral form factor (SFF). We show that,
firstly, the spectral statistics of the dual spectra, probed by the
dissipative
spectral form factor and spacing distribution, falls under the universality
class of the GinUE, and in particular displays level repulsion in the
complex
plane. Secondly, we obtain an exact analytical expression of SFF for the
GinUE,
and show that it universally describes the SFF of TI MBQC systems in the
scaling limit where $t$ and $L$ are large, while the ratio between $L$ and
$L_{\mathrm{Th}}$, the many body Thouless length is fixed. Thirdly, we
propose
variations of Ginibre models accounting for time periodicity, such that the
SFF
of Floquet MBQC (with or without TI) can be analytically described, thereby
removing the necessity of TI for the emergence of GinUE. Lastly, we remark
that
locality and the many-body nature of MBQC systems are required for the
emergence of the GinUE in large system sizes.

  We study aspects of chaos and thermodynamics at strong coupling in a
scalar
model using LCT numerical methods. We find that our eigenstate spectrum
satisfies Wigner-Dyson statistics and that the coefficients describing
eigenstates in our basis satisfy Random Matrix Theory (RMT) statistics. At
weak
coupling, though the bulk of states satisfy RMT statistics, we find several
scar states as well. We then use these chaotic states to compute the
equation
of state of the model, obtaining results consistent with Conformal Field
Theory
(CFT) expectations at temperatures above the scale of relevant
interactions. We
also test the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis by computing the
expectation
value of local operators in eigenstates, and check that their behavior is
consistent with thermal CFT values at high temperatures. Finally, we compute
the Spectral Form Factor (SFF), which has the expected behavior associated
with
the equation of state at short times and chaos at long times. We also
propose a
new technique for extracting the connected part of the SFF without the need
of
disorder averaging by using different symmetry sectors.

  Based on a Hamiltonian that incorporates the elastic coupling between a

non-equilibrium mechanical response of active viscoelastic biomatter. Our
model
accounts for the power-law viscoelastic response of the embedding polymeric
network as well as for the non-equilibrium energy transfer between active
and
tracer particles. Our analytical expressions for the frequency-dependent
response function and the positional autocorrelation function agree nicely
with
experimental data for red blood cells and actomyosin networks with and
without
ATP. The fitted effective active-particle temperature, elastic constants and
effective friction coefficients of our model allow straightforward physical
interpretation.

\\
  Modelling systems with networks has been a powerful approach to tame the
complexity of several phenomena. Unfortunately, such an approach is often
made
difficult by the large number of variables to take into consideration.
Methods
of dimensional reduction are useful tools to rescale a complex dynamical
network down to a low-dimensional effective system and thus to capture the
global features of the dynamics. Here we study the application of the
degree-weighted and spectral reduction methods to an important class of
dynamical processes on networks: the propagation of credit shocks within an
interbank network, modelled according to the DebtRank algorithm. In
particular
we introduce an effective version of the dynamics, characterised by
functions
with continuous derivatives that can be handled by the dimensional
reduction.
We test the reduction methods against the full dynamical system in different
interbank market settings: homogeneous and heterogeneous networks generated
from state-of-the-art reconstruction methods as well as networks derived
from
empirical e-MID data. Our results indicate that, for proper choices of the
bank
default probability, reduction methods are able to provide reliable
estimates
of systemic risk in the market, with the spectral reduction better handling
heterogeneous networks. Finally we provide new physical insights on the
nature
and working principles of dimensional reduction methods.

\\
  We introduce a new technique for cooling many-body quantum systems of
unknown
Hamiltonians to their ground states with a high fidelity. The technique
works
by switching on a strong field and applying a sequence of projective
measurements and RF pulses to polarize the system along the direction of the
external field before we adiabatically switch the field off. The evolution
of
the system towards its ground state is governed by the quantum adiabatic
theorem. The proposed technique is particularly relevant to the field of NMR
state preparation. We present numerical simulation results for the technique
applied to quantum spin chains with long and short range interactions.

  Single-chain nanoparticles (SCNP) are a new class of bio and soft-matter
polymeric objects in which a fraction of the monomers are able to form
equivalently intra- or inter-polymer bonds. Here we numerically show that a
fully-entropic gas-liquid phase separation can take place in SCNP systems.
Control over the discontinuous (first-order) change -- from a phase of
independent diluted (fully-bonded) polymers to a phase in which polymers
entropically bind to each other to form a (fully-bonded) polymer network --
can
be achieved by a judicious design of the patterns of reactive monomers along
the polymer chain. Such a sensitivity arises from a delicate balance between
the distinct entropic contributions controlling the binding.

  Network science has traditionally focused on pairwise relationships while
disregarding many-body interactions. Hypergraphs are promising mathematical
objects for the description of the latter ones. Here, we propose null
models to
analyse hypergraphs that generalise the classical Erd\"os-R\'enyi and
Configuration Model by randomising incidence matrices in a constrained
fashion.
After discussing them, we extend the definition of several network
quantities
to hypergraphs, derive their expected values and compare them with empirical
ones, to detect significant deviations from random behaviours.

Title: Lagrangian Density Space-Time Deep Neural Network Topology

\\
  As a network-based functional approximator, we have proposed a "Lagrangian
Density Space-Time Deep Neural Networks" (LDDNN) topology. It is qualified
for
unsupervised training and learning to predict the dynamics of underlying
physical science governed phenomena. The prototypical network respects the
fundamental conservation laws of nature through the succinctly described
Lagrangian and Hamiltonian density of the system by a given data-set of
generalized nonlinear partial differential equations. The objective is to
parameterize the Lagrangian density over a neural network and directly learn
from it through data instead of hand-crafting an exact time-dependent
"Action
solution" of Lagrangian density for the physical system. With this novel
approach, can understand and open up the information inference aspect of the
"Black-box deep machine learning representation" for the physical dynamics
of
nature by constructing custom-tailored network interconnect topologies,
activation, and loss/cost functions based on the underlying physical
differential operators. This article will discuss statistical physics
interpretation of neural networks in the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian domains.

Title: Spinon confinement in the gapped antiferromagnetic XXZ spin-1/2 chain
Authors: S. B. Rutkevich
Categories: cond-mat.str-el cond-mat.stat-mech
Comments: 47 pages, 18 figures
\\
  The infinite Heisenberg XXZ spin-(1/2) chain in the gapped
antiferromagnetic
regime has two degenerate vacua and kink topological excitations (which are
also called spinons) interpolating between these vacua as elementary
excitations. Application of an arbitrary weak staggered longitudinal
magnetic
field h induces a long-range attractive potential between two adjacent
spinons
leading to their confinement into 'meson' bound states. Exploiting the
integrability of the XXZ model in the deconfined phase h = 0, we perform
perturbative calculations of the energy spectra of the two-spinon bound
states
in the weak confinement regime at h \to +0, using the strength of the
staggered
magnetic field h as a small parameter. Both transverse and longitudinal
dynamical structure factors of the local spin operators are calculated as
well
in the two-spinon approximation in the weak confinement regime to the
leading
order in h.

Title: Intermittency, fluctuations and maximal chaos in an emergent

\\
  A hydrodynamic model of active, low Reynolds number suspensions, shows the
emergence of an asymptotic state with a universal spectral scaling and
non-Gaussian (intermittent) fluctuations in the velocity field. Such states
arise when these systems are pushed beyond a critical level of activity and
show features akin to high Reynolds number, inertial turbulence. We provide
compelling numerical and analytical evidence for the existence of such a
transition at a critical value of activity and further show that the
maximally
chaotic states are tied to this transition.

Title: Crosscap states in the XXX spin-1/2 spin chain
Authors: Christopher Ekman
Categories: hep-th cond-mat.stat-mech math-ph math.MP
Comments: 17 pages
\\
  We consider integrable boundary states in the XXX spin-1/2 spin chain. We
begin by briefly reviewing the algebraic Bethe Ansatz as well as integrable
boundary states in spin chains. Then a recently discovered class of
integrable
states known as crosscap states is described and expanded. In these states
each
spin is entangled with its antipodal spin. We present a novel proof of the
integrability of both a crosscap state that is known in the literature and
one
that has not previously been studied. We then use the machinery of the
algebraic Bethe Ansatz to derive the overlaps between the crosscap states
and
off-shell Bethe states.
